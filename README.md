üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
Built With
HTML5: Form structure.
Tailwind CSS: Styling (via CDN).
JavaScript: Form handling and API integration.
API Integration
Endpoint: https://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/getMP?postcode=${postcode}&key=${apiKey}
Limitation: The TheyWorkForYou API does not provide email addresses, so these are sourced from a hardcoded CSV in the script.
üìä Managing MP Data
Current Approach: Hardcoded CSV
The script includes a CSV string with MP details (forename, surname, constituency, email).
Used to match the API-returned MP name to an email address.
Upgrading to a Database
To keep MP data up-to-date without manual updates:
Source: Download the latest MP dataset in CSV format from data.parliament.uk.
Storage: Parse the CSV and store in a local database (e.g., SQLite) or JSON file with fields: Forename, Surname, Constituency, Email.
Automation: Use a script (e.g., Python) with a scheduled task (e.g., cron job) to update the database weekly.
Integration: Update the getMpData function in the JavaScript to query the database instead of the CSV.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Data Compliance: Follow data.parliament.uk usage policies for automated updates.
Security: In production, secure the API key by handling API calls server-side to avoid exposure in client-side code.
